## ðŸ’¬ Why this Task Interested Me

This task interested me because it combined several of my favorite aspects of frontend developmentâ€”responsive design, multilingual support (including RTL layouts), and dark/light theming. I was especially drawn to the challenge of creating a user-friendly experience for both Arabic and English users.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Focused On

In my solution, I focused on clean, reusable components, smooth animations with Framer Motion, and ensuring seamless theme and RTL toggling. I also paid close attention to layout structure and visual consistency across screen sizes.
